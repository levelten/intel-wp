Integrates results oriented analytics and visitor intelligence gathering into WordPress.

== Description ==

Intelligence's goal is to provide impactful and actionable data. It focuses on two areas, analytics and visitor data.

The analytics side is designed to enable smarter, empirical web development and content strategy. Intelligence streamlines
creation and management of a results oriented analytics measurement plan focused on goals and valued events. WordPress
integrated reports provide insight into the value a website and its various components are generating enabling teams
to better inspect and adapt to optimzed returns.

The visitor intelligence side integrates data about site visitors to drive deeper engagement and accelerate sales cycles.

The Intelligence for WordPress plugin integrates the LevelTen Intelligence API service ([intl.getlevelten.com](http://intl.getlevelten.com))
into WordPress. The Intelligence API provides a SAAS platform to integrate and extend Google Analytics and other
3rd party services. To review the Intelligence API Terms of Use visit: [intl.getlevelten.com/legal](http://intl.getlevelten.com/legal)
